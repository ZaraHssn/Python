Python Scripts for Data Science and Machine Learning

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The '01_datascience_survey_bar_plot.py' script reads a survey of 2,233 respondents on 6 data science topics:

1. Big Data (Spark / Hadoop)
2. Data Analysis / Statistics
3. Data Journalism
4. Data Visualization
5. Deep Learning
6. Machine Learning

The respondents were given three options for each topic: Very Interested, Somewhat interested, and Not interested.

The script:
1. loads the survey results saved to a csv file from: https://cocl.us/datascience_survey_data;
2. converts the numbers to percentages of the total respondents;
3. summarizes the survey results in a bar plot.

I made this script as part of 'Data Visualization with Python' certification with IBM.

The '02_crime_map_sf.py' script creates a dataframe with total number of crimes in each of the 10 neighborhoods in San Francisco and plots a Choropleth map to visualize the data.
The San Francisco crime dataset is loaded from: https://cocl.us/sanfran_crime_dataset
and the GeoJSON file (defining boundaries of the neighborhoods in San Francisco) is taken from: https://cocl.us/sanfran_geojson
